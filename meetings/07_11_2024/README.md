## Agenda
1. **Announcements**
    -  [OHDSI Global Symposium](https://www.ohdsi.org/ohdsi2024/) is Oct. 22 - 24, 2024.  Registration and hotel reservations are now open.
2. **Updates**
    - Retina: working on submitting concepts to SNOMED
    - Glaucoma: submitted VF concepts to LOINC
    - Uveitis: working on SUN criteria phenotypes
    - Pediatrics: working on JIA associated uveitis with uveitis group
    - Imaging: met this morning, working with JoeL Schuman's ACORN lab on standardizing image signals, working on metadata stored in imaging features table, planning initial project storing an existing dataset in OMOP format
    - ETL: will meet again so, OHSU intern working on trialing VA ETLs--will report to group at next workgroup meeting.
2. **Eye Related Flowsheet Concept Mapping**
    - Andrew Williams from Tufts will explain a project he needs help with from the eye care and vision research community
3. **Network Study Proposals**
     - NAION risk from semaglutide use
         - [JAMA Ophthalmology paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255) reports an observed increased risk of NAION in semaglutide users in neuro-ophthalmology registry at Mass Eye and Ear
         - Mike Chiang (NEI director) and Patrick Ryan (OHDSI leader) both approached us about conducting an OHDSI network study to assess this finding
         - Many of the phenotypes already exist; we need to develop one for NAION (which does not have a specific ICD 10 code--use ischemic optic neuropathy)
         - Volunteers are need to help with developing and running network study
         - Data partners are needed as well
         - Time sensitive--need to start planning and working ASAP
      - Network study using IOP
          - One idea from uveitis group: steroid induced ocular hypertension characterization
          - Other ideas?
          - Not as time critical, but these network studies improve visibility of our efforts in the eye care and vision research community & can help with grant submissions
4. **Goal setting for workgroup**
   - At least one more network study
    -  Grant submission (Fall/Winter)
    -  Add VA to OMOP datamarts (distance corrected, best recorded)
    -  Add missing imaging/VF concepts to standardized terminologies
    -  Others?
5. **Opportunities for Engagement.  Sign up [here](https://forms.gle/YF6o9EUicKQqZXad9)**
     - Visual Acuity testing: [visualacuity toolkit](https://github.com/HribarLab/visualacuity)        
     - Visual Acuity consensus building
       -  Plan Delphi process
       -  Participate as an expert
      -  ETL testing
          -  Distance, corrected VA
          -  Best recorded VA
      - Grant planning
      - Network study
          - NAION risk for semaglutide users
          - One that uses IOP
      - Eye related flowsheet concept mapping
4. **Next Meeting: Move to Aug 1st at 6:00 pm ET**
