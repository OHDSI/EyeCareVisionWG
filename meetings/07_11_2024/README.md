# Eye Care and Vision Research Workgroup Meeting 07/11/2024
# Theme: Network Studies


## Agenda
1. **Announcements**
    -  [OHDSI Global Symposium](https://www.ohdsi.org/ohdsi2024/) is Oct. 22 - 24, 2024.  Registration and hotel reservations are now open.
2. **Eye Related Flowsheet Concept Mapping**
    - Andrew Williams from Tufts will explain a project he needs help with from the eye care and vision research community
3. **Network Study Proposals**
     - NAION risk from semaglutide use
         - [JAMA Ophthalmology paper](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/fullarticle/2820255) reports an observed increased risk of NAION in semaglutide users in neuro-ophthalmology registry at Mass Eye and Ear
         - Mike Chiang (NEI director) and Patrick Ryan (OHDSI leader) both approached us about conducting an OHDSI network study to assess this finding
         - Many of the phenotypes already exist; we need to develop one for NAION (which does not have a specific ICD 10 code--use ischemic optic neuropathy)
         - Volunteers are need to help with developing and running network study
         - Data partners are needed as well
         - Time sensitive--need to start planning and working ASAP
      - Network study using IOP
          - One idea from uveitis group: steroid induced ocular hypertension characterization
          - Other ideas?
          - Not as time critical, but these network studies improve visibility of our efforts in the eye care and vision research community & can help with grant submissions
4. **Goal setting for workgroup**
   - At least one more network study
    -  Grant submission (Fall/Winter)
    -  Add VA to OMOP datamarts (distance corrected, best recorded)
    -  Add missing imaging/VF concepts to standardized terminologies
    -  Others?
5. **Opportunities for Engagement.  Sign up [here](https://forms.gle/YF6o9EUicKQqZXad9)**
     - Visual Acuity testing: [visualacuity toolkit](https://github.com/HribarLab/visualacuity)        
     - Visual Acuity consensus building
       -  Plan Delphi process
       -  Participate as an expert
      -  ETL testing
          -  Distance, corrected VA
          -  Best recorded VA
      - Grant planning
      - Network study
          - NAION risk for semaglutide users
          - One that uses IOP
      - Eye related flowsheet concept mapping
4. **Next Meeting: Move to Aug 1 or Aug 15th?**
