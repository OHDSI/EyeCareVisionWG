# ETL resources

This folder will contain shared resources that are helpful for efforts attempting to ETL ophthalmology data into OMOP instances.

Examples include:

- Vocabulary mappings (see [Vendor-specific resources][#vendor-specific-resources])
- Parsing code
- Best practices

## Vendor-specific resources

Certain EHR vendors, such as EPIC, do not permit sharing of mappings files to non-EPIC users. As such, we are placing these mapping documents in vendor-specific locations (such as the Epic UserWeb).
